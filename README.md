# wordle
A looong time ago I made a Wordle clone, because I wanted to hone my frontend skills. Now I'm doing it again, using typescript and react

Everything works at the moment, but nothing fancy has been implemented yet.

# Todo list
~~- Add animations to operations on the scoreboard~~\
~~- Tweak RWD - it can be done much better~~\
~~- Save results in localStorage~~\
~~- Highlight keys~~\
- More animations
