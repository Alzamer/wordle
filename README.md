# Game Rules
Wordle is a word puzzle game where the player must guess a secret word within a limited number of attempts.
The secret word is five letters long, and the player must guess it by entering words of the same length.
After each guess, the game provides feedback on the correctness of the guess:
Green letters indicate correct letters in the correct position.
Yellow letters indicate correct letters but in the wrong position.
Gray letters indicate letters that are not in the secret word.
The player has six attempts to guess the word correctly.
